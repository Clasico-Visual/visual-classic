# visual-classic
Attracted by the visual aesthetics of #Vaporwave, sounds and graphics, the idea arises of merging this style with images from other cultures, since the origin of this trend has been based on using Asian references and sounds derived from electronics. Initially the concept is to re-create a day where all the situations in the world came to life, from singers, actors, historical events, to athletes, series and even imaginary situations. It is not about the future, I do not know about the past, much less the present, it is not based on a certain time, it is only a day, a day that we all remember with nostalgia, the day that never existed. üóø ‚ô• Ô∏è
